    "\n",
    "#### In general, when someone says \"simulation\" they typically mean:\n",
    " * a set of rules to describe a system (i.e., a model)\n",
    " * the use of a set of \"rules\" to predict the behavior of a model under specific conditions.\n",
    " \n",
    "#### The specific rules (and the methods to evaluate them) will depend strongly on the discipline. \n",
    "> For example, the rules used to perform simulations of molecules are very different than those used to perform simulations of electronic circuits, assembly lines, traffic patterns, weather, galaxies, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note, the rules (i.e., model) may be very simple or very complex.  The specificity will depend on the system being considered, the properties that we wish to measure, the accuracy required, and the computational cost (among other considerations). \n",
    "> For example, in the field of molecular simulation, many models do not allow bonds to break/form (i.e., they do not model reactions). \n",
    "* This simplification is completely reasonable for many systems where reactions are not likely to occur over the timescale consider or at the temperature being investigated. Ignoring reactions also means simulations can be conducted at significantly reduced computational cost. "

    "## Development of a simulation model of a ball falling from rest\n",
    "As a simple example of a developing a model and performing a simulation, consider a classic physics problem: a ball falling from rest. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Let us first consider the most basic model.  This model requires two key rules in order to perform the simulation:\n",
    " * The ball accelerates towards the ground (at height = 0) due to gravity (i.e., g = $9.8 m/s^2$)\n",
    " * The displacement, velocity, acceleration, and time can be related by the kinematic equations of motion:\n",
    "  * $v_f = v_i + g*t$\n",
    "  * $d = 0.5*(v_i+v_f)*t$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We can use these rules to perform a simulation, shown in the Python script below.  \n",
    "This script will log the velocity (```velocity_array```) and height (```height_array```) of the ball as a function of time (```time_array```) and plot the results at the end. Note, that this script numerically evaluates the velocity and displacement at discrete points in time, spaced by the \"timestep\" (dt). \n",
    ">- If the timestep is very large, the simulation will miss important details about the motion of the ball (e.g., missing the collision with the ground). \n",
    ">- The smaller the timestep, the finer the resolution, although the longer the simulation will take (for such a simple model, computational cost is not really an issue, but certainly is for molecular simulations). \n",
    "\n",
    "This example starts with the ball at a height of 10 meters (```height_i = 10.0 ```) and an initial velocity of 0 m/s (```velocity_i = 0.0```).  These parameters could easily be changed to perform the simulation under different conditions; the model/rules do not need to change, only the input conditions to the simulation.  \n",
    "* For example, try setting the initial velocity to 5 m/s. \n",
