In general, one does not need to generate the .top and .gro files by hand, as there are extensive  databases,  tools to facilitate conversion from common (e.g., the ```pdb2gmx``` tool in GROMACS to convert from PDB to \".gro\" [(see the manual for more information)](http://manual.gromacs.org/programs/gmx-pdb2gmx.html)), and software such as [MoSDeF](http://github.com/mosdef-hub/) that will generate these files automatically.
