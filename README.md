Rapid overview of molecular simulation

## Overview
This repository is designed to provide users the resources to quickly
get up to speed with molecular simulations. This will not only include
information needed to better understand simulations, but it will also
provide specific information for workflow management, "sandboxed" development
environments, python specific scientific packages, etc.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)

** A python package mangement tool, useful for creating clean, reproducible
development environments

* Command line familiarity

** Most of the interaction with simulation programs involves some knowledge of
the GNU/Linux, or Unix command line interface.

** A useful guided tutorial for the command line can be found
[here](https://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
